Description: 
			This Module of PickUp is designed to handle allowing 
	one user to invite other players. If the user is logged in and 
	attempts to invite themselves, the code will ignore their name 
	and continue inviteing all the players it can find in the database.
	If the feild is blank, and they try to submit the form, they will 
	simply stay on the current page. Valid input, following these rules, 
	should simply be usernames, followed buy a comma so we can tell which is which.
	Inapproptiate data is handled.
